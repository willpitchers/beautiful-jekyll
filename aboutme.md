### the TL:DR version

I am a 30-something white dude with a PhD in genetics and a `.bash_profile` file.

### the slightly longer version

I like to say that I started life as a behavioural ecologist, but found that the majority of the most interesting questions had been answered (sometimes with a whole pile of answers – take your pick!), and so was seduced by genetics. I got my PhD in evolutionary quantitave genetics, and became a postdoc with the intention of doing QG and morphometrics. After a few years of that I discovered that I had morphed into a bioinformatician and that this newest iteration of Will had grown opinions about operating systems and programming languages that felt almost as important as the biology... life's a funny beast.

Traditionally, here's where I'd expect to put some interesting things that I spend my time on when I'm not working, but I'm a postdoc, so when I'm not working I'm either doing housework or asleep. I have a *very* big pile of novels that I'm *totally* going to find the time to read eventually – mostly SF and urban fantasy stuff – and a stack of video games that I am also going to finish just see if I don't. I enjoy walking the slightly longer route to work sometimes and if you haven't tried real ale then I heartily recommend it!
